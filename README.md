# CsgoAPIs for teams and players tracking

## OverView
The CSGO Teams & Player Statistics API is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application 
that allows you to manage and retrieve data related to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) teams and player statistics.
As a developer seeking to enhance my Node.js skills, I had an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with 
popular tools and technologies such as PostgreSQL, Sequelize, and Express.js.

## Learnings

1. Understand the fundamentals of Node.js and its event-driven, non-blocking I/O architecture.
2. Learn how to use the Express.js framework to create robust and scalable web applications.
3. Explore the PostgreSQL database and interact with it using Sequelize, a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Node.js.
4. Practice implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage data efficiently.
5. Familiarized with API and Databse design principles, such as defining endpoints and handling HTTP methods and creating database schemas and data modeling respectively.
